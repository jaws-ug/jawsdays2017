Allows for the ordering of categories and custom taxonomy terms through a simple drag-and-drop interface

== Description ==

Custom Taxonomy Order New Edition is a plugin for WordPress which allows for the ordering of taxonomy terms.

It supports the following features:

* Order (custom) terms through a simple drag-and-drop interface.
* No custom coding needed. It uses standard WordPress filters.
* It uses the available WordPress scripts and styles.
* The plugin is lightweight, without any unnecessary scripts to load into the admin.
* It falls in line gracefully with the look and feel of the WordPress interface.
* It uses it's own menu in the backend.
* Translated or translatable.
* Custom functions to order the taxonomies themselves.
* There is no Pro version, everything works in the Free version.

It is a continuation (or fork) of Custom Taxonomy Order, which has been discontinued.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Order posts from the 'Term Order' menu in the admin
4. Optionally set whether or not to have queries of the selected taxonomy be sorted by this order automatically.
5. Optionally set `'orderby' => 'term_order', 'order' => 'ASC'` to manually sort queries by this order.
6. Enjoy!

== Upgrade Notice ==

If you update from the original Custom Taxonomy Order please deactivate that first, then activate this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I sorted the terms in the WordPress backend, but I don't see it changed in the frontend =

Did you set the option for that taxonomy to use that custom order? Make sure to check it so the filters run
with your taxonomy.

= My custom taxonomy is not available in the menu page =

This plugin will only offer to sort them when the taxonomy is set to public. Make sure you use 'register_taxonomy'
with the public parameter set to true (default).

= How do I sort the terms when using a custom query? =

When you use default functions like get_terms or get_categories, this should not be needed.

If you do need to, you can apply the sorting for the taxonomy by using:
	'orderby' => 'term_order'.

= I use get_term_children but the terms do not get sorted =

This function only fetches the ID's of the terms, so it is impossible to sort them by term_order. If you do need the sort_order, use a function like get_terms with the 'child_of' parameter. That will fetch an array of WP_Term objects that can be sorted.

= I have a custom taxonomy that uses the Tag Cloud functionality, but it doesn't sort like it should. =

If it is a much used plugin, can you tell me what is the name for the taxonomy?
In the customtaxorder_wp_get_object_terms_order_filter it needs to be added, and the get_terms filter should not run
on that taxonomy. The tag_cloud_sort filter should do that.

If it is a custom taxonomy, you can also use a filter:

	<?php
	add_filter( 'customtaxorder_exclude_taxonomies', 'add_taxonomy_to_customtaxorder_exclude_taxonomies' );
	function add_taxonomy_to_customtaxorder_exclude_taxonomies( $taxonomies ) {
		$taxonomies[] = 'directory'; // name of your tag taxonomy.
		return $taxonomies;
	}
	?>

= I'm using the_tags function, but it doesn't sort as it should. =

There is a bug with the the_tags function, where it will sort according to the setting for categories.
This happens in the 'customtaxorder_apply_order_filter' function where the $args has two taxonomies but only one orderby can be returned.

= What capabilities are needed? =

For sorting the terms you need the manage_categories capability.

= Can I sort the taxonomies themselves? =

There is an admin page to sort them, and save them in the database.

You can use a function to sort taxonomies themselves like this:

	<?php
	$taxonomy_objects = get_object_taxonomies( 'post', 'objects' );
	$taxonomy_objects = customtaxorder_sort_taxonomies($taxonomy_objects);
	foreach (  $taxonomy_objects as $tax ) {
		echo $tax->name . "<br />";
	}
	?>

The function requires a parameter with an array of taxonomy objects.

= Is there an API? =

There is an action that you can use with add_action. It is being run when saving the order of terms in the admin page.
You could add the following example to your functions.php and work from there.

	<?php
	function custom_action($new_order) {
		print_r($new_order);
	}
	add_action('customtaxorder_update_order', 'custom_action');
	?>

= How can I add my own translation? =

Translations can be added very easily through [GlotPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/custom-taxonomy-order-ne).
You can start translating strings there for your locale. They need to be validated though, so if there's no validator yet,
and you want to apply for being validator, please post it on the support forum. I will make a request on make/polyglots to
have you added as validator for this plugin/locale.

Email any other questions to marcel at timelord dot nl.

== Screenshots ==
